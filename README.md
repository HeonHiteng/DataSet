# DataSet
You are given three files. The PDF, which contains your instructions... and the CSV, from which your data will be read. You are also given some java code, which does the data reading for you. Please read the PDF file carefully. You will be using loops (whichever you believe is suitable), and also knowledge from previous chapters where applicable. Good luck!
